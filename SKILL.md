# Viraloop

Analyze any website and generate a 6-slide carousel for TikTok/Instagram with visual coherence. Posts directly to your feed (no drafts) with auto trending music. Both APIs (Gemini + upload-post.com) have free plans — no credit card needed to start.

## Philosophy: Daily Iteration Loop

The key to growth is **consistency + learning**:

1. **Post 1 carousel per day** - Consistency beats virality
2. **Track everything** - Every post generates data
3. **Learn from data** - What hooks work? What times? What visuals?
4. **Iterate and improve** - Each carousel is better than the last

```
Day 1: Post → Analyze → Learn
Day 2: Post (improved) → Analyze → Learn  
Day 3: Post (better) → Analyze → Learn
...
Day 30: You have 30 data points and a refined strategy
```

The skill maintains a `learnings.json` that accumulates insights across all posts:
- Best performing hooks
- Optimal posting times
- Visual styles that work
- CTAs that convert

**This is not a one-shot tool. It's a growth engine.**

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Full business research
node {baseDir}/scripts/analyze-web.js https://your-website.com

# 2. Generate 3 hook variants (SHOCK, CURIOSITY, CONTRADICTION)
GEMINI_API_KEY="your-key" bash {baseDir}/scripts/generate-hooks.sh

# 3. Review hooks with vision, pick the best one

# 4. Generate slides using selected hook type
GEMINI_API_KEY="your-key" bash {baseDir}/scripts/generate-slides.sh [shock|curiosity|contradiction]

# 5. Review slides (agent verifies text and quality)
# Agent uses vision to check each slide

# 6. Publish to TikTok + Instagram
UPLOADPOST_TOKEN="your-token" bash {baseDir}/scripts/publish-carousel.sh

# 7. Check analytics (after 24-48h)
UPLOADPOST_TOKEN="your-token" bash {baseDir}/scripts/check-analytics.sh 7

# 8. Learn from data for next carousels
node {baseDir}/scripts/learn-from-analytics.js
```

## Hook Categories (Visual Novelty System)

The key to breaking the 1000 views ceiling is **visual novelty in the first slide**. We generate 3 hook types:

| Type | Goal | Visual Style |
|------|------|--------------|
| **SHOCK** | Stop the scroll with impossible/absurd | Surreal, chaotic, "wait what?" |
| **CURIOSITY** | Create information gap | Mysterious, secrets being revealed |
| **CONTRADICTION** | Show impossible combination | Relaxed + intense, "how is that possible?" |

### Anti-Stock Filter
All hooks include anti-stock prompting to avoid:
- Generic stock photo aesthetics
- Shocked pretty girl trope
- Typical influencer poses
- Overused laptop-coffee setups
- Corporate handshake scenes

### Hook Testing Workflow
1. Generate 3 variants with `generate-hooks.sh`
2. Review with vision, score each 1-5 on novelty
3. Kill anything that looks familiar
4. Use best hook for carousel
5. Track which hook TYPE performs best over time

## Image Model

Uses **gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview** to generate slides.
- Local script: `{baseDir}/scripts/generate_image.py`
- Supports image-to-image for visual coherence between slides

## Step 1: Full Research (`analyze-web.js`)

Performs COMPLETE business investigation:

### 1. Brand Analysis
- Brand name (from domain or title)
- Logo (URL or SVG)
- CSS colors (background, primary, links, headings)
- Typography (body font, heading font)
- Favicon

### 2. Content Analysis
- Headline and tagline
- All headings (page structure)
- Features/benefits (title + description)
- Pricing/plans
- Testimonials
- Stats/metrics
- CTAs
- Meta tags (title, description, og:image)

### 3. Internal Pages
- Navigates pricing, features, about, testimonials
- Extracts additional content from each page

### 4. Competitor Detection
- Searches for known competitor mentions in content
- List of 20+ known SaaS competitors (Buffer, Hootsuite, Later, etc.)
- Detects "vs", "alternative", "compare" sections
- No external searches required - all from the website itself

### 5. Storytelling
- Detects business type (SaaS, ecommerce, app)
- Detects niche (social-media-tools, developer-tools, etc.)
- Generates hooks based on customer pain points
- Defines pain points from features
- Creates transformation narrative (before → after)

### 6. Visual Context
- Brand colors in CSS format
- Color description for prompts
- Typography for slides
- Image themes based on niche
- Style guide for coherence

**Output:** `/tmp/carousel/analysis.json`

## Step 2: Generate Slides (`generate-slides.sh`)

Generates 6 slides with visual coherence using image-to-image:

| Slide | Type | Content |
|-------|------|---------|
| 1 | **HOOK** | Question/problem that hooks. Establishes ALL visual style. |
| 2 | **Problem** | Agitate the pain. "You upload to TikTok... then Instagram..." |
| 3 | **Agitation** | Competition advancing. Urgency. |
| 4 | **Solution** | Present the product with its value proposition. |
| 5 | **Feature** | Main benefit. |
| 6 | **CTA** | "Link in bio 👆" + call to action. |

### Visual Coherence
- Slide 1 generates the base style (colors, typography, mood)
- Slides 2-6 use image-to-image with slide 1 as reference
- Maintains same color palette, fonts, and aesthetic

### Prompts per Slide
Each slide has:
- **Text:** The main message
- **Scene:** Detailed visual description for background
- **Style:** Based on brand analysis

**Output:** 
- `/tmp/carousel/slide-{1-6}.jpg`
- `/tmp/carousel/caption.txt`

## Step 3: Review with Vision

After generating, the agent MUST review each slide:
- ✓ Text is legible and correct
- ✓ Words are not cut off
- ✓ Correct spelling
- ✓ Visual coherence between slides
- ✓ Acceptable image quality

If there are errors, regenerate the specific slide.

## Image Format

- **Resolution:** 768x1376 (9:16 vertical ratio)
- **Format:** JPG (TikTok does NOT accept PNG)
- **Text:** Large, bold, with shadow for readability
- **Background:** Scene relevant to the business, not just solid colors

## Step 4: Publish to TikTok + Instagram (`publish-carousel.sh`)

Publishes the carousel to TikTok and Instagram using Upload-Post API.

```bash
UPLOADPOST_TOKEN="your-token" bash {baseDir}/scripts/publish-carousel.sh
```

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/upload_photos`
- Docs: https://docs.upload-post.com/api/upload-photo

**Parameters sent:**
- `platform[]=tiktok` + `platform[]=instagram`
- `auto_add_music=true` - Adds music on TikTok automatically
- `tiktok_title` - Short title (max 90 chars) + hashtags
- `title` - Full caption for Instagram
- `privacy_level=PUBLIC_TO_EVERYONE`
- `media_type=IMAGE` - Photo carousel on Instagram
- `async_upload=true` - Process in background
- `photos[]` - The 6 slides JPG

**⚠️ IMPORTANT Instagram:** 
After publishing, user must go to Instagram and add viral music manually:
1. Open Instagram → Profile → The post
2. Edit → Add music
3. Search for trending/viral song

**Output:** Saves `request_id` in `post-info.json` for tracking.

## Step 5: Analyze Performance (`check-analytics.sh`)

Gets TikTok and Instagram analytics to see what works.

```bash
UPLOADPOST_TOKEN="your-token" bash {baseDir}/scripts/check-analytics.sh 7
```

**Endpoints used:**

1. **Profile analytics:**
   ```
   GET /api/analytics/{user}?platforms=tiktok
   ```
   → Followers, likes, comments, shares, impressions

2. **Total impressions:**
   ```
   GET /api/uploadposts/total-impressions/{user}?platform=tiktok&breakdown=true
   ```
   → Total views per day

3. **Per-post analytics:**
   ```
   GET /api/uploadposts/post-analytics/{request_id}
   ```
   → Views, likes, comments for the specific carousel (TikTok + Instagram)

Docs: https://docs.upload-post.com/api/get-analytics

## Step 6: Learn and Improve (`learn-from-analytics.js`)

Analyzes data and saves learnings for future carousels.

```bash
node {baseDir}/scripts/learn-from-analytics.js
```

**Generates:**
- `learnings.json` - Accumulated knowledge base
- Best hooks (those generating most views)
- Optimal posting times
- Recommendations for next carousel

## Full Flow

```bash
# 1. Research business
node {baseDir}/scripts/analyze-web.js https://my-product.com

# 2. Generate slides
GEMINI_API_KEY="..." bash {baseDir}/scripts/generate-slides.sh

# 3. Review with vision (agent verifies text)
# Agent checks each slide image

# 4. Publish
UPLOADPOST_TOKEN="..." UPLOADPOST_USER="myuser" bash {baseDir}/scripts/publish-carousel.sh

# 5. (After a few hours/days) Analyze
UPLOADPOST_TOKEN="..." UPLOADPOST_USER="myuser" bash {baseDir}/scripts/check-analytics.sh 7

# 6. Learn for next carousels
node {baseDir}/scripts/learn-from-analytics.js
```
